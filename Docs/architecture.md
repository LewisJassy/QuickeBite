# Architecture

## Overview

The food delivery app is designed using a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance. Each service is responsible for a specific functionality and communicates with other services via REST APIs and message queues.

## Services

### User Service
- **Technology**: Flask
- **Responsibilities**: User authentication, profiles, and preferences.
- **Database**: MySQL, Redis

### Restaurant Service
- **Technology**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Responsibilities**: Restaurant data, menus, and reviews.
- **Database**: MongoDB

### Order Service
- **Technology**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Responsibilities**: Order creation, tracking, and history.
- **Database**: MySQL, Redis

### Delivery Service
- **Technology**: Flask
- **Responsibilities**: Delivery personnel management, tracking, and logistics.
- **Database**: MongoDB

### Admin Service
- **Technology**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Responsibilities**: Admin functionalities like managing users, restaurants, orders, and deliveries.
- **Database**: MySQL, MongoDB

## Frontend

### User Frontend
- **Technology**: React, Vite
- **Responsibilities**: User interface for browsing restaurants, placing orders, and tracking deliveries.

### Admin Frontend
- **Technology**: React, Vite
- **Responsibilities**: Admin interface for managing users, restaurants, orders, and deliveries.

## Communication

- **REST APIs**: For synchronous communication between frontend and backend services.
- **Message Queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka)**: For asynchronous communication between microservices (e.g., order service notifying delivery service).

## Security

- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: For user authentication and authorization.
- **OAuth**: For third-party authentication (e.g., Google, Facebook login).

## Caching

- **Redis**: For caching frequently accessed data to improve performance and reduce database load.

## Deployment

- **Docker**: Containerize each microservice for easy deployment and scaling.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrate and manage containerized applications for scalability and reliability.

## Database

- **MySQL**: For structured data like user profiles, orders, and transactions.
- **MongoDB**: For unstructured data like restaurant menus, reviews, and delivery logs.
- **Redis**: For caching frequently accessed data like session information, order status, and real-time updates.
